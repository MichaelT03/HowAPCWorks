                    A PC, or personal computer, is a personal computing device that is composed of a CPU as well as 
                    other hardware and software components that make it ideal for various uses by an individual. 
                    There are two main types of PC's: the laptop and the desktop.

            A computer can simply be thought of as an input/output machine. It takes input from the user via 
            peripherals, processes it, and then generates output also via peripheral devices. All computers 
            are powered by some form of PSU, and all computers must contain a central processing unit. This 
            processor is assisted via the general processing unit to execute all of the information and 
            graphics that run through the computer. There are several components that can be used to 
            customize the user's experience, such as increase RAM speed or create more storage, and these are 
            usually connected on or around the motherboard. Computers can physically become much more complex 
            depending on what their intended uses are, but these are the main physical components that can 
            normally be found in every single computing device.

            Also called a main processor, its electronic circuitry executes instructions

            Computers have changed a lot over time. The first devices were so massive that a single one filled up an entire room 
            and took elongated periods of time to perform simple tasks. Today, we all carry computers in our pockets in the form 
            of smartphones and we can perform supercomputing in a matter of seconds. This increase in performance can be accredited 
            to the upgrades that were made to the central processing unit.

            A GPU performs graphics-related calculations very quickly, they were developed as a way to offload those tasks from 
            CPUs for graphics applications.

            Many people that are interested in PCs or PC gaming are familiar with a GPU. Despite how many people know what a GPU
            is and what it does, many people do not know how it works. The below video demonstrates how a Graphics Processing Unit
            functions inside of a computer.
